			<p>My name is Kris Gunnars, and I own this website.</p>
			<p>I am a full-time investor and internet entrepreneur.</p>
			<p>
				I own and manage the investing company Skuggi Capital, which
				specializes in investing in US-listed stocks.
			</p>
			<p>
				Kris Gunnars is actually just a pen name. My full name is Kristjan
				Mar Gunnarsson, but it&#8217;s an Icelandic name that is pretty hard
				to pronounce.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am also a professional blogger, possibly one of the most-read
				bloggers in the history of the internet.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2012 I started a nutrition blog called Authority Nutrition, which
				ended up becoming the world&#8217;s biggest nutrition site with over
				10 million visits every month.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hundreds of millions of people have now read my articles about
				health and nutrition.
			</p>
			<p>
				I ended up selling my site in the summer of 2017 to Healthline,
				which has now surpassed WebMD to become the world&#8217;s biggest
				health website.
			</p>
			<p>
				After I sold my company, I decided to build my wealth by investing
				in the stock market.
			</p>
			<p>
				I started this website in part to help myself learn more about
				investing. I&#8217;ve found that the best way to learn something is
				to research and write about it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Given my previous success with writing content, I think I have a
				natural talent at being able to present and explain things better
				than most writers on the web.
			</p>
			<p>
				My education is in medicine, where I got a bachelor&#8217;s degree
				from the University of Iceland.
