All data shown on this website is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon to make trading or investing decisions.

However, we are committed to showing the highest-quality and most accurate data possible. If you see any mistakes or inaccuracies, please send a message via the [contact form](/contact/) to let us know about it.

## Stocks Covered

Stock Analysis covers all stocks and ETFs currently listed on the main US exchanges: NASDAQ, NYSE, NYSE American and NYSE Arca. We also cover numerous stocks that are listed on the OTC markets. We also have data on companies that are listed outside of the United States but trade on US exchanges.

## Stock prices

Real-time data on stock prices is gotten from <a href="https://iexcloud.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IEX Cloud</a>. However, this real-time price may differ slightly from the price shown on the actual exchange. When IEX real-time data is not available, a 15-minute delayed price is shown.

Pre-market and after-hours stock prices are also delayed by 15 minutes and provided by <a href="https://www.utpplan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nasdaq UTP</a>. For stocks that trade on the OTC markets, we provide either 15-minute delayed or end-of-day stock prices.

For each stock, the time when the stock price was last updated is shown below the stock price. The timestamp is shown in Eastern Time.

## Fundamental data

Stock Analysis gets its fundamental financial data from the Sharadar SF1 dataset via <a href="https://data.nasdaq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nasdaq Data Link</a>. This data pulls information from the official annual and quarterly SEC reports of publicly traded companies.

The fundamental data is updated daily, but in some cases companies are late to file their annual (10-K) and quarterly (10-Q) reports. When that happens, the financial data on Stock Analysis will not update until these reports have been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

This ensures that all the financial data shown is as accurate as possible. It is the same official and audited data that is submitted to the SEC.

We gather financial information for upcoming IPOs ourselves using data from the S-1 and S-1/A reports submitted to the SEC.

We also use various data points from <a href="https://www.barchart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barchart</a> and <a href="https://finnhub.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finnhub</a>, particularly for ETFs.

## Quality control

Each new stock and ETF is added to the site manually. It is not done with an automated process. A human being reviews the data to ensure that it is accurate.

We also do regular scans and spot checks to look for inaccuracies, or outdated or missing data.

In addition, we gather data from various sources about new stock listings, delistings, name or symbol changes, mergers, acquisitions and others to ensure that all stocks on the site are displayed in the most accurate way possible.
