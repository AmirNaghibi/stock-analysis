He
My name is Kris Gunnars, and I own this website.

I am a full-time investor and internet entrepreneur.

I own and manage the investing company Skuggi Capital, which specializes in investing in US-listed stocks.

Kris Gunnars is actually just a pen name. My full name is Kristjan Mar Gunnarsson, but it’s an Icelandic name that is pretty hard to pronounce.

I am also a professional blogger, possibly one of the most-read bloggers in the history of the internet.

In 2012 I started a nutrition blog called Authority Nutrition, which ended up becoming the world’s biggest nutrition site with over 10 million visits every month.

Hundreds of millions of people have now read my articles about health and nutrition.

I ended up selling my site in the summer of 2017 to Healthline, which has now surpassed WebMD to become the world’s biggest health website.

After I sold my company, I decided to build my wealth by investing in the stock market.

I started this website in part to help myself learn more about investing. I’ve found that the best way to learn something is to research and write about it.

Given my previous success with writing content, I think I have a natural talent at being able to present and explain things better than most writers on the web.

My education is in medicine, where I got a bachelor’s degree from the University of Iceland.
