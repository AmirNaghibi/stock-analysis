This is the public repo for the front-end of [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/).

If you are interested in helping us develop the site, then send an email to kris@stockanalysis.com and I will help set you up with the required permissions and API keys.

The site is running on React/NextJS and is written in typescript. The front-end communicates with a headless WordPress back-end.

I can set up new API routes on the back-end in order to build new front-end features. We are subscribed to multiple different premium data providers.
