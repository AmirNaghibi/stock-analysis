This is the public repo for the front-end of [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/). We want to build the world's best free investing website.

The site is running on React/NextJS and is written in Typescript. The front-end communicates with a headless WordPress back-end.

If you are interested in helping us develop the site, then send an email to kris@stockanalysis.com and I will help set you up with the required permissions and API keys.

I can also set up new API routes on the back-end if you want to build new front-end features. We are subscribed to multiple different premium data providers.
